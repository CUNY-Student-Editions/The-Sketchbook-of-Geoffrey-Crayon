<p class="pf"><span class="it">The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.</span> was first published serially by C. S. Van Winkle, in from 1819-1820. In 1848, Irving prepared a revised edition for publisher George Putnam. At that time, he added two new stories ("London Antiques"; "A Sunday in London") and added both a new preface and post-script to "Rip van Winkle." Additionally, Irving altered the original order of the essays. The text of this ebook edition is based on Project Gutenberg files and scans of the 1848 Revised edition available on Archive.Org. </p>
